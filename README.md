# Text Mining and Natural Language Processing-CS3TM20

This project involves training a logistic regression classifier to predict the group label of two Newsgroups based on the provided dataset. The task was accomplished by implementing various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process the input text and extract features.

## Project Overview
The main objectives of the project were as follows:

- Data Collection: Downloading two Newsgroups based on the student number provided.

- NLP Analysis: Utilizing NLP methods at different linguistic levels, including morphology, lexicon, syntax, and semantics, to process the input text and extract features. The baseline model used was the tf-idf weighted unigram bag-of-words model.

- Feature Extraction: Besides the baseline model, additional text extraction methods were explored.

- Model Training: Implementing logistic regression as the classifier for the two-class dataset.

- Evaluation Metrics: Presenting the results of Newsgroup prediction using various evaluation metrics, including overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 measure.
